# cozy
Cozy is a platform for home automatisation written in Rust and Typescript. By utilizing Gatsby for our frontend work we 
will be able to deliver state of the art user interfaces and dashboards. Expansions will be written in Rust and therefor 
reap the benefits of native performance, and strong type systems. 

The user will be able to choose between yaml, javascript/typescript, or rust for their automatisation. 

Since user interfaces are written in Gatsby, users will be able to override and extend the Gui with and custom npm 
modules they want.
